# Welcome to my portfolio!

I'm Maria Bezobiuk and I'm a junior QA/QC engineer, in another words - 
manual software tester.

I'm glad you are here.  It means, you were interested in my CV or social page
 and were curious, what is the level of my skills.

These are examples of my work product.

The site was tested [newtea.ua](https://newtea.ua/)

Every test activity starts from analysis of project´s idea,

 

## User stories

**User story** is a requirement written from a user position and can 
include any functional or non-functional user´s need, the reason behind it,
 and acceptance criteria.

## Use case diagram

The logic of some relationships between the use cases, actors, and systems 
can be visualised in **use case digram**. It´s usually simple and shows what 
behavior is expected in software underdeveloped. We can say, it is a primary 
form of system or software requirements and helps us design a system from 
the end user's perspective.

## Checklist

**Checklist** is a simpliest form of test documentation, I think.  
It´s a list of test activities needed to be done with checkbox done or not. 
It can contains a columns ¨Pass/Fail¨ and ¨Coments¨ for tester´s comfort :smirk:

## Decision Table

**Decision table** is a visual way to represent multiple conditions and 
actions for them.  
Essentially it is a structured exercise to formulate requirements when 
dealing with complex business rules.
