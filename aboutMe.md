I have a technical and analytical mindset. Since school, I have been 
very attentive to details, trying to do my homework perfectly so sometimes 
My strength is the need for a deep understanding of the
learning material, which I absorb quickly, so it becomes part of me. 
This means that I can explain and use it anytime I needed.  

I have three children and sometimes help them with homework. 
This is rare because I've explained to them, that the lack of parts
on the base causes a misunderstanding of the next level of material. 

Also, I am a self-organized person. I studied HTML and the basics of Python in 
Sololearn app a few years ago. Also, I've been studying SQL basis on it.
And I created this site myself after I got first acquainted 
with Git and ultimate markdown. As you can see, I'm self-taught and 
interested in IT person.

I took part in EPAM's external course Software Functional Testing Winter 
Program 2022. I studied ISTQB foundation Syllabus and Software Testing - 
Base Course (Svyatoslav Kulikov). 

Also, I took part in EPAM's external Test Automation Laboratory 2022. 
I learned the basics of C#, OOP, automation testing with Selenium Webdriver and
NUnit.

Quality assurance interested me because it is needed at all stages of 
software development. It usually begins with testing requirements and work 
products, helps in the analysis and design stage, works closely with developers to create the 
best quality product and is needed in a partially automated form at the 
maintenance stage for regression testing. 

I have a good and strong base on which I can add practical and more specific 
knowledge and grow up!
